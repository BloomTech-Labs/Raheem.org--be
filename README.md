# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed via Google Firebase: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/raheem-b6ed6/overview) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally: We integrated Firebase directly into the React application.

### Backend framework goes here

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

-    Point One - The stakeholder wanted it.
-    Point Two - We recommended alternatives, they did not appeal to the stakeholder.
-    Point Three - The project is small enough that it didn't require a deeply complex backend.
-    Point Four - The stakeholder wanted it.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoints

Firebase hosts its data in a series of "collections" that house the documents containing the information returned to the server. Here are the typical CRUD operations using Firebase. We are using an example collection called colName

#### Organization Routes

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control | Description                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").get() | owners     | Return all the records in the collection colName |
| ADD    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").add({content, content, content}) | owners     | Add a record to the collection colName |
| PUT    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").doc(id).update()  | owners         | Modify a specific record by id in the collection.             |
| DELETE | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").doc(id).delete()  | owners         | Delete a record by id in the collection.                      |


# Data Model

Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. Unlike a SQL database, there are no tables or rows. Instead, you store data in documents, which are organized into collections. Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ COLLECTIONS

emails
officers
reports
stories

#### DOCUMENTS IN COLLECTIONS
##### EMAIL

---

```
{
  id: UUID
  organization_id: UUID foreign key in ORGANIZATIONS table
  first_name: STRING
  last_name: STRING
  role: STRING [ 'owner', 'supervisor', 'employee' ]
  email: STRING
  phone: STRING
  cal_visit: BOOLEAN
  emp_visit: BOOLEAN
  emailpref: BOOLEAN

}
```

##### OFFICERS

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
    
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
