# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed via Google Firebase: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/raheem-b6ed6/overview) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally: We integrated Firebase directly into the React application.

### Backend framework goes here

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

-    Point One - The stakeholder requested it specifically as the framework for their backend.
-    Point Two - We recommended alternatives that could produce more complicated relationships, they were not of interest to the stakeholder for this project.
-    Point Three - The project is small enough that it didn't require a deeply complex backend.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoints

Firebase hosts its data in a series of "collections" that house the documents containing the information returned to the server. Here are the typical CRUD operations using Firebase. We are using an example collection called colName

#### Organization Routes

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control | Description                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").get() | owners     | Return all the records in the collection colName |
| ADD    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").add({content, content, content}) | owners     | Add a record to the collection colName |
| PUT    | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").doc(id).update()  | owners         | Modify a specific record by id in the collection.             |
| DELETE | firebase.firestore().collection("colName").doc(id).delete()  | owners         | Delete a record by id in the collection.                      |


# Data Model

Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. Unlike a SQL database, there are no tables or rows. Instead, you store data in documents, which are organized into collections. Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.
